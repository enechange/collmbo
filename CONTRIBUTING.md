# Contributing to Collmbo

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines when submitting pull requests.

## Before Submitting a PR

### 1. Run Validation

Ensure code quality by running:

```bash
./validate.sh
```

This runs formatting, linting, type checking, and tests.

### 2. Sign Commits with DCO

All commits must be signed with DCO. Use `git commit -s` to sign your commits.

- Use your real name (no pseudonyms)
- All commits in a PR must be signed
- If the DCO check fails, see the check details page for instructions on fixing unsigned commits
